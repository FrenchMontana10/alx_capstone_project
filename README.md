**Project Title:** Interactive Quiz Game

**Objective:** 
The objective of this project is to develop an engaging and interactive quiz game that allows users to test their knowledge on various topics. The game will provide multiple-choice questions with a time limit for each question. Users will receive instant feedback on their answers and earn points based on correctness and speed.

**Features:**

1. **User Authentication:**
   - Users can create accounts or log in using existing credentials.
   - Option for guest play without an account.

2. **Topic Selection:**
   - Users can choose from a variety of topics/categories for the quiz (e.g., General Knowledge, Science, History, etc.).
   - Option to select a random quiz.

3. **Gameplay:**
   - Each game session will consist of a predefined number of questions (e.g., 10 questions per game).
   - Questions will be presented one at a time.
   - A timer will count down the time available to answer each question.

4. **Question Types:**
   - Multiple-choice questions with four options.
   - True/False questions for variety.

5. **Scoring System:**
   - Points awarded based on correctness and speed of response.
   - Bonus points for consecutive correct answers.

6. **Feedback and Progress:**
   - Immediate feedback on the correctness of the answer after each question.
   - Display of current score and progress bar.

7. **Leaderboard:**
   - A global leaderboard displaying top scores for each category.
   - Option to filter leaderboards by category and time period.

8. **Achievements and Badges:**
   - Users can earn badges and achievements for various milestones (e.g., perfect score, consecutive correct answers, etc.).

9. **Lifelines (Optional):**
   - Option to include lifelines (e.g., "50-50", "Ask the Audience", etc.) for more interactive gameplay.

10. **Settings:**
    - Sound settings (mute, volume control).
    - Display preferences (e.g., light/dark mode).

11. **Data Management:**
    - Secure storage of user accounts and game progress.
    - Analytics for user engagement and performance.

12. **Technology Stack:**
    - Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (possibly a front-end framework like React).
    - Backend: Node.js or Python (with a framework like Express or Django).
    - Database: MySQL or MongoDB for user accounts and game data.

13. **Security:**
    - Implement secure authentication and authorization mechanisms.
    - Protect against common web vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, XSS, CSRF).

14. **Testing:**
    - Unit testing for critical components.
    - User acceptance testing for overall functionality.

15. **Deployment:**
    - Deploy the application on a web server, using a cloud service like AWS, Heroku, or similar.

**Timeline:**
- Planning and Design: 2 weeks
- Development: 6-8 weeks
- Testing and Debugging: 2-3 weeks
- Deployment and Launch: 1 week

**Budget:**
- Development Costs (if applicable)
- Cloud Service Costs (if applicable)
- Marketing and Promotion (optional)

**Future Enhancements:**
- Mobile App Version
- Social Integration (e.g., share scores on social media)
- In-app Purchases or Premium Features (if monetization is a goal)


1. **User Registration/Authentication:**
   - User opens the app and is presented with an option to log in or register.
   - If they choose to register, they provide necessary information and create a username and password.

2. **Home Screen:**
   - After logging in, the user is directed to the home screen.
   - Here, they see options to start a new quiz, view their profile, access settings, and view leaderboards.

3. **Selecting a Quiz:**
   - User selects a quiz category (e.g., General Knowledge, Science, History).
   - Optionally, they can choose to play a random quiz.

4. **Gameplay:**
   - The app presents the first question with multiple-choice options.
   - User selects an answer within the time limit.

5. **Answer Evaluation:**
   - After the user submits an answer or the timer runs out, the app evaluates the answer's correctness.
   - The app displays whether the answer was correct or incorrect, along with the correct answer if needed.

6. **Scoring:**
   - Points are awarded based on correctness and speed of response.
   - The user's score is updated after each question.

7. **Progress Tracking:**
   - The app displays the current question number and progress (e.g., "Question 3 of 10").

8. **Lifelines (Optional):**
   - If included, the user can choose to use a lifeline (e.g., "50-50", "Ask the Audience") for help.

9. **Next Question:**
   - The app presents the next question and the process repeats until all questions are answered.

10. **End of Game:**
    - Once all questions are answered, the app displays the user's final score.
    - Optionally, the user can see a summary of their performance (e.g., number of correct answers, time taken).

11. **Leaderboard:**
    - The app updates the user's score on the leaderboard for that category, if applicable.

12. **Profile and Achievements:**
    - The user can view their profile, which includes their username, avatar (if set), and achievements/badges earned.

13. **Settings:**
    - The user can access settings to customize preferences (e.g., sound settings, display mode).

14. **Navigation and Exit:**
    - The user can navigate back to the home screen at any point to start a new quiz or access other features.
    - There's an option to log out or exit the app.

15. **Feedback and Analytics:**
    - The app may prompt the user for feedback or ask them to rate the app.
    - Analytics are collected for user engagement and performance metrics.

16. **Security and Data Management:**
    - User data is securely stored, and best practices for security are implemented.

Remember, this is a high-level overview and can be customized based on your specific requirements and features. Additionally, thorough testing should be conducted at each stage to ensure the app functions smoothly.
