**Project Title:** Interactive Quiz Game

**Objective:** 
The objective of this project is to develop an engaging and interactive quiz game that allows users to test their knowledge on various topics. The game will provide multiple-choice questions with a time limit for each question. Users will receive instant feedback on their answers and earn points based on correctness and speed.

**Features:**

1. **User Authentication:**
   - Users can create accounts or log in using existing credentials.
   - Option for guest play without an account.

2. **Topic Selection:**
   - Users can choose from a variety of topics/categories for the quiz (e.g., General Knowledge, Science, History, etc.).
   - Option to select a random quiz.

3. **Gameplay:**
   - Each game session will consist of a predefined number of questions (e.g., 10 questions per game).
   - Questions will be presented one at a time.
   - A timer will count down the time available to answer each question.

4. **Question Types:**
   - Multiple-choice questions with four options.
   - True/False questions for variety.

5. **Scoring System:**
   - Points awarded based on correctness and speed of response.
   - Bonus points for consecutive correct answers.

6. **Feedback and Progress:**
   - Immediate feedback on the correctness of the answer after each question.
   - Display of current score and progress bar.

7. **Leaderboard:**
   - A global leaderboard displaying top scores for each category.
   - Option to filter leaderboards by category and time period.

8. **Achievements and Badges:**
   - Users can earn badges and achievements for various milestones (e.g., perfect score, consecutive correct answers, etc.).

9. **Lifelines (Optional):**
   - Option to include lifelines (e.g., "50-50", "Ask the Audience", etc.) for more interactive gameplay.

10. **Settings:**
    - Sound settings (mute, volume control).
    - Display preferences (e.g., light/dark mode).

11. **Data Management:**
    - Secure storage of user accounts and game progress.
    - Analytics for user engagement and performance.

12. **Technology Stack:**
    - Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (possibly a front-end framework like React).
    - Backend: Node.js or Python (with a framework like Express or Django).
    - Database: MySQL or MongoDB for user accounts and game data.

13. **Security:**
    - Implement secure authentication and authorization mechanisms.
    - Protect against common web vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, XSS, CSRF).

14. **Testing:**
    - Unit testing for critical components.
    - User acceptance testing for overall functionality.

15. **Deployment:**
    - Deploy the application on a web server, using a cloud service like AWS, Heroku, or similar.

**Timeline:**
- Planning and Design: 2 weeks
- Development: 6-8 weeks
- Testing and Debugging: 2-3 weeks
- Deployment and Launch: 1 week

**Budget:**
- Development Costs (if applicable)
- Cloud Service Costs (if applicable)
- Marketing and Promotion (optional)

**Future Enhancements:**
- Mobile App Version
- Social Integration (e.g., share scores on social media)
- In-app Purchases or Premium Features (if monetization is a goal)
